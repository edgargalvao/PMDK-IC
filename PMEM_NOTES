For accurate reproduction on PMEM devices:
1) Direct the compiler to emit clwb instructions instead of clflushopt by changing compiler flag from "-mclflushopt" to "-mclwb" in:
 - benchmarks/Makefile
 - Immutable-Datastructure-c++/CMakeLists.txt
 - vacation/CMakeLists.txt
 - nvm_malloc/Makefile

2) Replace compiler intrinsics for clflushopt (_mm_clflushopt) with clwb (_mm_clwb) in following locations:
 - Immutable-Datastructure-C++/immer/nvm_utils.hpp

3) Replace manual PMDK override in pmdk/src/libpmem/x86_64/init.c line 376 from if(1) to if(0).

4) Update MMAP_FLAGS in nvm_malloc by passing additional compiler flag "-DPMEM_ENABLED" in nvm_malloc/Makefile.

5) Update MMAP FLAGS in pmdk/src/common/file.c from "MAP_SHARED" to "MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE|MAP_SYNC".
